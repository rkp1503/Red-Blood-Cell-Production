\section{Conclusion}

What we have done is shown that the only possible way for Red Blood Cell population to maintain in an equilibrium state is when $\gamma = 1$. An idea that can be extended from this work is to see what would happen if blood loss occurred at some day $n$ and how the state of the Red Blood Cell population would be affected if a small or a large portion of that population has been removed from the body.
