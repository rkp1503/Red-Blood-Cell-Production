Red Blood Cells are a type of cells that are present in the human body. They are red and the shape of a Red Blood Cell is like the shape of a donut but without a hole. In other words, a biconcave disc~\cite{article1}. Red Blood Cells are created through a process called erythropoiesis. It takes about a week for a Red Blood Cell to fully develop in the bone marrow and its life span is about four months~\cite{article2}. As humans inhale oxygen, the Red Blood Cells extract that oxygen and deliver it into the body. At the same time, the Red Blood Cells give carbon dioxide for humans to exhale~\cite{web1}.
